I'm fengtao, a 26-year old engineer. I currently work as JAVA Engineer in the E-commerce industry.

I studied Computer Science at Zhengzhou Institute of Aeronautical Industry Management and I'm mainly interested by Programming, Reading and Sports.

More recently, I started using Python to build some Web App and I take a real pleasure developing with such a concise and high-level language.


无径之林 常有情趣

无人之岸 几多惊喜

世外桃源 何处寻觅

聆听涛乐 须在海里

爱我爱你 更爱自然
